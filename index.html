    <h2>UL Solutions</h2>
        <p class="title">Wireless Testing Technical Support Intern</p>
        <p>Fremont, California</p>
        <p>Coded in Python, writing scripts to run tests for multiple wireless technologies 
          including Bluetooth (BT), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Digital Transmission System 
          (DTS), U-NII. I primarily worked in Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electromagnetic 
          Interference Labs/Chambers testing various products and devices from clients for 
          certification within FCC and international. Through this experience, I was able to 
          implement the teaching strategies that I learned from my previous jobs to effectively 
          train other interns and support them during the early learning stages.</p>

    <h2>Tribal Wisdom Academy</h2>
        <p class="title">Camp Mentor</p>
        <p>Los Gatos, California</p>
        <p>Taught and supervised elementary school children at “maker camp” 
          where campers make swords, furniture, and wooden decorations. I 
          taught campers to safely use power drills, hammers, saws, 
          wrenches, and other tools. This experience improved both my 
          creativity and endurance as I sought to keep campers engaged 
          in activities that were physically demanding for them. In the 
          future, I plan to lean heavily on intrinsic rather than extrinsic 
          motivation when leading others; I will find ways to make my peers' 
          responsibilities engaging rather than motivated by pay.</p>

    <h2>Spectrum School</h2>
        <p class="title">Instructional Aide</p>
        <p>San Jose, California</p>
        <p>I helped with care, education, and training for children with autism. I 
          worked with teachers to create an implement unique lesson plans and 
          individualized care for students. During school hours, I utilized behavior 
          management techniques to improve student progress. I also drafted incident 
          reports: legal documents to be reviewed by a court at a later date. This 
          position required me to balance the sometimes contradictory interests of 
          the individual student, the desires of the family, and the school itself. 
          I learned to weigh these interests dynamically, adapting to what was most 
          important both in the moment and long-term.</p>

    <h2>Camp Shalom</h2>
        <p class="title">Camp Counselor</p>
        <p>Los Gatos, California</p>
        <p>I assisted with teaching elementary school children science and technology 
          topics. For ten weeks, I was in charge of over a dozen campers. I instructed 
          volunteers who would help keep the campers engaged. This experience was the 
          first time I worked on a team with others looking to me for instruction. 
          While it was easy to find tasks for other to complete, the true difficulty 
          lies in finding tasks that make people feel that their contributions are 
          useful or meaningful.</p>
